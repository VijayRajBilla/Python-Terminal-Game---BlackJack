# Python Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Python Blackjack Game! This is a simple text-based blackjack game written in Python. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, while competing against the dealer.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-blackjack.git
    cd python-blackjack
    ```

2. Run the game using Python:
    ```bash
    python blackjack.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game:
    - Press '1' to hit (draw another card).
    - Press '2' to stand (keep your current hand).

4. The dealer will then take their turn. The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher.

5. The game will determine the winner based on the final totals.

## Code Overview

The code consists of the following main parts:

- **Deck Initialization**: Creates and shuffles a deck of cards.
- **Player and Dealer Hands**: Deals initial hands to both the player and the dealer.
- **Game Logic**: Handles the player's actions (hit or stand) and the dealer's actions.
- **Sum Calculation**: Calculates the total value of a hand, considering the value of aces.
- **Win/Loss Determination**: Determines the winner based on the final totals.
- **Game Restart**: Allows the player to restart the game after it ends.

## Future Additions

Here are some potential enhancements to make the game more robust and enjoyable:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure the user inputs are valid (only '1' or '2' for hit or stand).
2. **Game Restart Option**: Allow the player to choose whether to play another game after the current one ends.
3. **Display Hidden Dealer Card**: Reveal the dealer's hidden card at the end of the game.
4. **Ace Handling**: Handle the Ace value dynamically during the game.
5. **Deck Refill**: Refill or reshuffle the deck when it runs low on cards.
6. **Keep Track of Wins/Losses**: Maintain a counter for player and dealer wins.
7. **Enhance Output Formatting**: Make the output clearer and more readable.
